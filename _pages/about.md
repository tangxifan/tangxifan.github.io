Xifan Tang is the CTO at RapidFlex US Inc, where he leads the development on eFPGA IP and EDA tools. 
He codes and maintain the [OpenFPGA project](https://github.com/lnis-uofu/OpenFPGA), which is an open-source EDA tool chain enabling automate customizable FPGA IP generation.
Based on OpenFPGA, he has accomplished more than 8 eFPGA tapeouts within 5 years in collaboration with a small-sized teams, which was not possible previously with a team of 50+ experienced engineers and 12+ months.
OpenFPGA has been adopted by commercial FPGA vendors with 15+ successfully tapeouts, including but not limited to
