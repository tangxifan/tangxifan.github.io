I am currently the CTO at RapidFlex US Inc.
I received my PhD degree in Integrated System Laborartory (LSI), Ecole polytechnique fédérale de Lausanne(EPFL). 
My research interests concern FPGA architecture exploration, Electronical Design Automation (EDA) tool development and emerging technologies.
I focus on the circuit design, modeling and architecture exploration and EDA of Resistive Random Access Memory (RRAM)-based FPGAs.

I have authored and co-authored 50+ technical papers and hold 3 US patent. You can find details in my [publication page](/tangxifan/publications/)
